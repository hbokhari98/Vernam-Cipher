# Vernam-Cipher
The Vernam Cipher uses an encryption key (or One Time Pad) which must be equal or longer in characters than the plaintext. It should be random and be used only once. The plaintext and the key are combined to produce the cipher text. The message can then be decrypted with the key and the cipher text.

# Vernam cipher uses a random string of data that is the same length as the data we want to encrypt, we then XOR the characters together one by one to generate the encoding. We then XOR it against the same cipher to decrypt it.
